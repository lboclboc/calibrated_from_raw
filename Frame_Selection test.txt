// This is a test to set the region of over scan area for a camera, it's different
// From AstroImageJ Pluings menu, Input-Output, click on DCRaw Reader...
// Open the RAW file that you want to analyze the over scan are on
// Setup DCRaw to this
// Enable "Use temporary directory for processing"
// White balance = None
// Output colorspace = raw
// Enable "Document mode (no color, no interpolation)"
// Enable "Document mode without scaling (totaly raw)"
// Read as = 16-bit linear
// Interpolation quality = High-speed, low-quality bilinear, this one should not matter
// Disable "Half size"
// Enable "Do not rotate or scale pixels (preserve orientation and aspect ratio)"
// Enable "Show metadata in Result window
//
// Click on OK button

// Run this macro "Frame_Selection test.txt
// Check the image, it should now have a rectangle drawed on top of the image
// The over scan area are normally to the left and a small on the top too, the latter not used here
// Zoom and increase the contrast of the image and you will see the border of the over scan region
// The rectangle shall not reach into the image area, have at least a margin of 5 pixel
// If you have many cameras, set the width to the most narrow width of your cameras but not less than 20 pixel wide
// 
// Below the most common setup of reactangle, test with different values and run this macro once again
// You only run DCRaw Reader once for every camera image you want to test
